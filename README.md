# Probabilistic Models

This repo contains description and usage of: 
 * Expectation Maximization algorithm for haplotype phasing of genotypes very short in length and amount. For demonstrational purpose. 
 * Kimura 2-parameter model with optimx for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of genetic distance between two DNA sequences. Again, for demonstrational purpose.
